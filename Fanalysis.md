Why did this stop being a useful code? 

> The multiplicative Cipher is not a useful code because of how easily it can be cracked. The Multiplicative Cipher, otherwise known as the Affine cipher is not useful because of it's simplicity

What made it useful when it was being used? What are other interesting uses of this code or similar codes?
> Dating back to earlier than 1983, this cipher is only useful when you do not have an easy decryption method. There are 286 non-trivial affine ciphers, which are used all over the world.
