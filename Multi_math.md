# Mathematical Analysis

## How many possible keys or codes could there be? 
* 12 possible keys

## How would you attempt to decode this message if you didn't have a key? 
* 

## What is the mathematical complexity to solve the code?
* Multiplicative cyphers can work with very large keys, such as 9,100,101. 
* It would take a long time for a computer to solve the code through brute-forcing through the keys.
