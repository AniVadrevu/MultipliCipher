## Mathematical Analysis

### How many possible keys or codes could there be? 
* 12 possible keys

### How would you attempt to decode this message if you didn't have a key? 
* Decrypting symbols involves converting the values into numbers with a simple basic procedure of addition or subtraction.
* There isn't much information on decoding without a key, but there is a formula for decoding with a key:
* P=a-1 * C mod 26. 
* For example, if you encoded with a=3, then the encryption function would be C=3*P mod 26

### What is the mathematical complexity to solve the code?
* Multiplicative cyphers can work with very large keys, such as 9,100,101. 
* It would take a long time for a computer to solve the code through brute-forcing through the millions of keys.
